Neighbourhood Watch Toronto
## What is Neighbourhood Watch?
Neighbourhood Watch is:

1. “You watch my place and I’ll watch yours.”
2. If we see anything suspicious, we call the police
    * 911 for real emergencies or crimes in progress;
    * the local police division station front desk for non-urgent matters.
3. a broader social network to receive information from our Association (or other groups such as Toronto Police Services) about:
    * crime prevention tips generated by our Association to remind people how to reduce the likelihood they will be victims of crimes; and
    * crime statistics regarding what crime has occurred recently in your neighbourhood recently:
